## Repository structure
This repository is organized on multiple branches in order to separately handle the 3 different assignments for the course. In particular:
### The _assignment1_ branch  
* The [_assignment1_ branch](https://github.com/Pg96/IoT-2021-Individual-Assigments/tree/assignment_1) contains all the code, scripts, etc. generated during the completion of the **first** assignment, which uses a single physical STM-32 nucleo device to sense the environment, send the gathered information to the cloud and receive instructions about how to trigger the actuators accordingly.
### The _assignment2_ branch  
* The [_assignment2_ branch](https://github.com/Pg96/IoT-2021-Individual-Assigments/tree/assignment_2) ranch contains all the code, scripts, etc. generated during the completion of the **second** assignment, which uses an arbitrary number of m3 nodes from the FIT-IoT lab real-world testbed communicating with each other via the _6LoWPAN_ protocol over _802.15.4 mesh networking_ technologies.
### The _assignment3_ branch  
* The _assignment3_ branch - WIP
### The _main_ branch  
* The _main_ branch Is not directly related to the 3 assignments, as it is designed to keep compatibility of the device developed for the first assignment with the updated scripts and codes from AWS developed and modified to complete the other 2 assignments.


Each branch contains a custom _README.md_ file that addresses the questions and the requests issued by each specific assignment.
